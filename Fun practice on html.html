        <h1>What Can We Expect From The Info Class</h1>
        
        <h2>An Interesting Professor</h2>
        <p>I had one of my first class in UW with an interesting Professor
        He is a teacher in the infomatics department and his way of
        teaching the students has many similar ways as when I was in Agape.</p>


        <h2>A Well Tempered TA</h2>
        <p>She was the TA in the infomatic class and she is very patient with the studnets.
        When I have problems in making html, She helped me out and get me into the right
        track of becoming a newbee in the field of computer programming.</p>

        <h3>Practice of Breaks</h3>
        <p>The breaks seems really fun,<breaks>
        I can play with it for the entire night,<breaks>
        I think I can start to enter into the field of programming<breaks>
        since I already have a glasses, <breaks>
        and although my head itsn't bold yet, <breaks>
        I think I might get an engineer hair style in the future.</p>
